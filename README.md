# Design Patterns [![PHP Composer](https://github.com/EdmondDantes/design-patterns/actions/workflows/php.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EdmondDantes/design-patterns/actions/workflows/php.yml)

Common Design Patterns for `Stateful` applications.

## Patterns

* `Execution Plan` - [Patterns that allow you to create a sequence of actions that can be executed in a specific order](docs/execution_plan.md).
* `Factory` - A pattern that allows you to create objects.
* `Final Handlers` - Method for determining handlers that will be executed at the very end of the FLOW, 
even if an error occurs.
* `Immutable` - A pattern/trait that allows you to create immutable objects.
* `Interceptor` - [A pattern that allows you to intercept the execution of a method and modify its behavior with arguments](docs/interceptor.md).
* `IntervalRunner` - Interval execution strategy that provides logic for running some code.
* `Iterators` - Group of contracts for iterators that extends basic conventions.
* `Pool` - Pool pattern focused on resource usage in a multithreaded environment.
* `ScopeControl` - A pattern that imposes restrictions on operations based on the current scope.
